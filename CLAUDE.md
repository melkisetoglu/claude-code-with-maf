# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A **workshop-style tutorial** that grows a Claude Code-style console agent on top of **Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)** in .NET 9, talking to Claude via the official Anthropic SDK adapter. The single project at the repo root grows step-by-step across 17 chapters in 6 milestones (see [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md)).

Current state: **Step 12 — cross-session memory via `FileMemoryProvider`**. Third `AIContextProvider` attached to `options.AIContextProviders`, alongside Step 10's `CompactionProvider` and Step 11's `AgentSkillsProvider`. Built via `new FileMemoryProvider(new FileSystemAgentFileStore(memoryDir), _ => new FileMemoryState { WorkingFolder = "" }, new FileMemoryProviderOptions { Instructions = ... })`. Opt-in by directory existence: if `./memory/` doesn't exist, the provider isn't attached. `WorkingFolder = ""` makes memory **shared across all sessions** of this repo (return `session.Id` for per-session memory; stretch). The provider **auto-registers 5 tools** (`FileMemory_SaveFile`, `_ReadFile`, `_DeleteFile`, `_ListFiles`, `_SearchFiles`) — discovered prophylactically via "list every tool" smoke before writing any harness code (Step 11's lesson, applied). Memory writes **bypass the approval gate** — silent autonomous note-taking by design; the `Instructions` string sets the soft contract ("memory is silent; `write_file` for user-visible work"). The framework auto-maintains `memories.md` (an index of saved memos with their descriptions) so the model on a fresh session can glance at what's there before reading any specific file. State persists in the session bag under `"FileMemoryProvider"` key. New slash command `/memory` lists files under `./memory/` (including the framework's `memories.md` / `*_description.md` bookkeeping). `./memory/` is gitignored (user-specific notes). Tests: 7 new (4 `MemoryCommandTests` + 3 `FileMemoryRegistrationTests`); `MemoryCommandTests` joined `[Collection("Console-shared-static")]` for cwd-race protection. 148 unit tests total.

This means: when adding code, the unit of work is "the next step." Each step is one sitting, ends in a clean state, gets a git tag (`step-00`, `step-01`, …) and a `[step-NN]` commit prefix so `git log --oneline` reads like a table of contents. Don't sneak future-step features into the current step.

## Run / build

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

dotnet build
dotnet run                          # new session, prints its id
dotnet run -- --continue            # resume the most recent session
dotnet run -- --resume <id-prefix>  # prefix-match, like git/claude
dotnet run -- --list                # list past sessions
```

Short flags: `-c`, `-r`, `-l`, `-h`. In-chat (slash-prefixed): `/exit` / `/quit` / Ctrl+D, `/clear` (new session, previous one stays on disk), `/id`.

`ANTHROPIC_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` overrides the model (default `claude-haiku-4-5`; try `claude-sonnet-4-6` for harder questions).

## Tests

```bash
dotnet test                              # run all
dotnet test --filter Category=Unit       # unit tier (fast, no API key)
# dotnet test --filter Category=Live     # live tier (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) — none yet
```

Two-tier strategy: **Unit** tier covers harness plumbing without hitting the API (SessionStore, ReadFile, eventually a fake-AIAgent ChatLoop test). **Live** tier hits real Claude — gated to nightly/dispatch in CI, never runs on every PR. No live tests exist yet; they land alongside an explicit testing-interlude step.

Tests live in [tests/ClaudeChat.Tests/](tests/ClaudeChat.Tests/). Each test class is tagged `[Trait("Category", "Unit")]`. **The main project's `.csproj` excludes `tests/**` from its compile glob** — without that, the SDK auto-includes test files into the main project and the build fails.

`SessionStore.Dir` is a settable static (was `const`) so tests can swap it for a temp directory. Production never reassigns it.

## Architecture (the bit that needs explaining)

The whole app is in [Program.cs](Program.cs) using top-level statements. Two layers compose:

1. **`AnthropicClient`** — raw HTTP client from the `Anthropic` SDK package.
2. **`AsAIAgent(...)`** — extension from `Microsoft.Agents.AI.Anthropic` that adapts the SDK client into a MAF **`AIAgent`**.

After `AsAIAgent()`, the code never speaks Anthropic-specific types again — everything is written against the MAF abstractions (`AIAgent`, `AgentSession`, `RunStreamingAsync`). That's the whole point: future steps add tools, approval gates, logging, compaction, sub-agents — all provider-agnostic.

### Session persistence — the metadata wrapper

MAF gives you `SerializeSessionAsync` → `JsonElement` and `DeserializeSessionAsync(JsonElement)` → `AgentSession`. That's the round-trip primitive; it tracks conversation state but knows nothing about ids, listings, or previews.

To get `--list` and prefix-resume, we wrap the framework blob with our own metadata:

```json
{
  "id": "a3f7c102",
  "createdAt": "...", "updatedAt": "...",
  "model": "claude-haiku-4-5",
  "preview": "first user message snippet",
  "session": { ...framework's opaque JsonElement... }
}
```

One file per session at `sessions/<id>.json`, written **after every turn** (so Ctrl+C can't lose state). Ids are 8 hex chars (4 random bytes); resume does prefix-match like `git checkout abc`. The `session` field is opaque — treat as a black box and hand it back to `DeserializeSessionAsync` untouched.

## Target folder structure

As steps land, **introduce each folder lazily the first time a step needs it** — don't pre-create empty ones. After Step 2, five code folders exist (`Agent/`, `Harness/`, `Persistence/`, `Tools/`, `tests/`) plus `tutorial/`; the rest will appear when their step does. Destination shape:

```

> **Naming note.** Code folder is `Persistence/`, runtime data folder is `sessions/`. They must not share a root word — macOS's case-insensitive filesystem makes git's gitignore evaluation case-insensitive too, so a `sessions/` ignore rule would also hide a `Sessions/` code folder. Keeping the names distinct avoids the trap.

Two boundaries worth holding:

- **`Program.cs` stays small.** Entry point only. Once `Agent/AgentBuilder.cs` exists, composition lives there and `Program.cs` just calls into it. Keeps each step's diff focused.
- **`Harness/` is separate from `Agent/`.** TUTORIAL.md frames it: "MAF is the runtime, not the UX." Anything in `Harness/` is code *you* write (slash commands, plan mode, streaming polish), not framework extension points. Don't mix the two folders.

Folders mirror MAF's own concept boundaries (`Tools`, `Providers`, delegating agents) so a reader checking out `step-12` can guess where the new file lives before opening it.

## MAF is preview — APIs drift

The package is `Microsoft.Agents.AI.Anthropic 1.5.0-preview.*`. **The published MS Learn samples have already drifted from the actual API in this version.** Known drifts:

| MS Learn sample | Actual API |
|---|---|
| `APIKey` | `ApiKey` |
| `AgentThread` | `AgentSession` |
| `agent.GetNewThread()` | `await agent.CreateSessionAsync()` |

**When something doesn't compile or a name doesn't exist, do not trust web docs — reflect on the restored DLLs to find the real names.** Expect more drift on each prerelease bump. If you find a new drift, add it to the table in [README.md](README.md).

## Tutorial chapter convention

Each step has a chapter in `tutorial/NN-name.md` with these sections, in order: **Goal**, **MAF concept**, **Code walkthrough**, **Verify**, **Pitfalls**, **Stretch**. Match that shape when adding new chapters.

## Voice — for any prose written here (README, TUTORIAL, chapters)

Honest over polished. Short and direct over elaborate. If it sounds like marketing copy, rewrite it. The repo's own framing — "in motion, not arrived" — applies: be explicit when something is preview/unfinished/not-yet-written rather than papering over it. (Workspace-level voice rules in [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) apply if present.)
